switchMap | Cancels the current subscription / request and can cause race condition
	    Use for get requests or cancelable requests like searches

concatMap | Runs subscriptions / requests in order and is less performant
            Use for get, post and put request when order is important

mergeMap  | Runs subscriptions / requests in parallel
            Use for put, post, and delete methods when order is not important

exhaustMap | Ignores all subsequent subscriptions / requests until completes
             Use for login when you do not want more requests until initial one is complete
